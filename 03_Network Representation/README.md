## 🔹 Overview
This repository documents a **hands-on networking lab** completed as part of the **CCNA: Introduction to Networks** course.  

The lab uses **Cisco Packet Tracer** to represent a small-to-medium business network, incorporating multiple devices, connections, and technologies that are foundational to CCNA studies.  

The activity focuses on:
- Identifying common network components  
- Understanding intermediary and end devices  
- Exploring different types of media connections  
- Comparing LANs and WANs  
- Practicing the client-server model  
- Building troubleshooting and design skills  

---

## 📘 Objectives
- Recognize and categorize devices in a Packet Tracer topology  
- Explain the purpose of servers, clients, and intermediary devices  
- Evaluate criteria for choosing network media types  
- Compare and contrast **LANs** and **WANs**  
- Explore simplified internet representation in Packet Tracer  
- Practice connecting devices and verifying connectivity

## 🖥️ Lab Instructions

### Part 1: Identify Components
- Explore the **icon toolbar** in Packet Tracer (end devices, intermediary devices, media).  
- Count endpoint devices, intermediary devices, and types of media connections.  
- Identify non-desktop end devices.  

### Part 2: Device Purposes
- Explain the **client-server model** (Server-PT vs Desktop/Laptop PCs).  
- List functions of intermediary devices (e.g., routing, switching, traffic management).  
- Identify criteria for choosing media (speed, cost, distance, environment).  

### Part 3: LANs vs WANs
- Define and compare **LAN** and **WAN** with examples.  
- Count LANs and WANs in the topology.  
- Briefly describe the internet and its complexity beyond Packet Tracer’s simplified model.  
- Explore common internet connection methods for home users (DSL, fiber, mobile broadband) and businesses (leased lines, MPLS, VPNs).  

---

## ⚡ Challenge Activities
- Add a new **end device** to a LAN and configure it for connectivity.  
- Add a new **intermediary device** and connect it to a LAN/WAN.  
- Create a new network with at least **two LANs connected by a WAN**.  
- Save and revisit your Packet Tracer file as your skills grow.
