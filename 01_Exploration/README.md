# 🌐 Network Topology Design & Physical-to-Logical Mapping

## 📖 Project Overview
This project focused on the architecture of small-scale local area networks (LANs) using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. The primary objective was to demonstrate proficiency in both **Logical Design** (data flow/addressing) and **Physical Implementation** (rack placement/cabling constraints).

## 🚀 Core Competencies Demonstrated

### 1. Multi-Segment Network Construction
- Assembled basic network topologies including end devices (PCs, Laptops), networking hardware (Switches, Routers), and appropriate media (Copper Straight-Through/Cross-over).
- Configured basic Layer 3 connectivity to verify end-to-end communication across the segment.

### 2. Logical View Analysis
- Utilized the **Logical Workspace** to map out data flow and device relationships.
- Conducted connectivity tests and traffic observation to ensure proper network logic and collision domain separation.

### 3. Physical Workspace Synchronization
- **Spatial Planning:** Navigated the **Physical View** to place equipment within virtual cities, offices, and wiring closets.
- **Rack & Cable Management:** Organized networking hardware within standard 19-inch racks and managed cable lengths and port connections to simulate real-world data center environments.
- **Environment Context:** Verified that logical connections translated correctly to physical patch panels and wall outlets.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Simulation Environment:** [Cisco Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com)
- **Deployment Tasks:** Device Provisioning, Cable Selection, Physical Rack Mounting.

## 📈 Key Insights
Transitioning between views emphasized the importance of **Cable Management** and **Environmental Factors** that are often overlooked in purely logical diagrams. This dual-view approach ensures that a design is not just theoretically sound, but physically deployable.
