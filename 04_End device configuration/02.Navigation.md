## 🔹 Overview
This repository documents my **hands-on lab practice with Cisco IOS CLI** as part of the CCNA: Introduction to Networks course.  
The focus is on **primary command modes**, **essential commands**, and **keyboard shortcuts** that make navigation efficient.  

By exploring these modes and commands, I gained practical experience in configuring and managing Cisco devices using the CLI.

## 📘 IOS CLI Primary Command Modes
Cisco IOS has several hierarchical modes. In this lab, I worked with the following:

| Mode | Prompt Example | Purpose |
|------|----------------|---------|
| **User EXEC Mode** | `Router>` | Basic monitoring, limited commands (e.g., `ping`, `show`). |
| **Privileged EXEC Mode** | `Router#` | Full access to device commands, including configuration and troubleshooting. |
| **Global Configuration Mode** | `Router(config)#` | Used to configure system-wide settings. |
| **Subconfiguration Modes** | `Router(config-if)#`, `Router(config-line)#` | Specific configuration for interfaces, lines, routing protocols, etc. |

---

## 🛠️ Commands Practiced
- `enable` → Enter **Privileged EXEC Mode**  
- `disable` → Return to **User EXEC Mode**  
- `configure terminal` → Enter **Global Configuration Mode**  
- `exit` → Exit current mode (step back one level)  
- `Ctrl + Z` → Exit configuration mode and return to **Privileged EXEC Mode**  
- Subconfiguration commands (e.g., `interface g0/0`, `line vty 0 4`)

## ⌨️ IOS CLI Hotkeys & Shortcuts
Efficient navigation in IOS CLI relies on keyboard shortcuts. Here are the most useful ones:

| Shortcut | Action | Source |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **Ctrl + A** | Move cursor to beginning of line |  |
| **Ctrl + E** | Move cursor to end of line |  |
| **Ctrl + F** | Move cursor forward one character |  |
| **Ctrl + B** | Move cursor backward one character |  |
| **Esc + F** | Move forward one word |  |
| **Esc + B** | Move backward one word |  |
| **Up Arrow / Ctrl + P** | Recall previous command |  |
| **Down Arrow / Ctrl + N** | Recall next command |  |
| **Ctrl + W / Esc + Backspace** | Delete word to the left |  |
| **Ctrl + U** | Delete entire line |  |
| **Ctrl + K** | Delete from cursor to end of line |  |
| **Tab** | Auto-complete command |  |
| **?** | Context-sensitive help |  |

## 🚀 Lab Highlights
- Practiced **switching between IOS modes** using commands and shortcuts.  
- Configured devices in **Global Configuration Mode** and **Subconfiguration Modes**.  
- Used **hotkeys** to speed up CLI navigation and editing.  
- Learned how to **exit and return quickly** using `exit` and `Ctrl + Z`.
